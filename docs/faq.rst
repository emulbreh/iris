Why does lymph crash with UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character â€¦?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since many lymph commands produce unicode output, you have to set your locale
to UTF-8, e.g. with

.. code:: bash

    $ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

If you want to pipe lymph commands with Python 2, you might also have to set
``PYTHONIOENCODING``

.. code:: bash

    $ export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8
